# GapMinder-Analysis
GapMinder is a dataset compiled by the GapMinder foundation that tracks key indices (like population, GDP etc.) across different countries of the world. In this dataset I am investigating 4 key indices- life expectancy, GDP per capita, child mortality and fertility across 193 different countries of the world. The data is compiled from 1800-2018.

The purpose of this project is to practice data wrangling and exploratory data analysis on a given dataset.
